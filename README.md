# Image-Noise-Reduction-with-Auto-Encoders
Created a Classifier to identify handwritten digits images using Neural Networks on TensorFlow.
Improved performance by adding Auto-Encoder which reduces the noise in the image , by reducing dimensionality using Neural Networks through a hidden layer with lower number of nodes than input
